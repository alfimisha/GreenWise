These containers are a rigid polypropylene container designed for multiple-uses: 1) they are display-ready and usable for chilled and humidified storage and display conditions; 2) they have an open side and base structure that can be quickly assembled for use and folded for storage/cleaning; and 3) the insides have rounded inner edges. IFCO RPCs are made in different standard sizes covering a range of fruit and vegetable produce applications. IFCO’s RPC types are mutually compatible (i.e., in terms of stacking properties) for segregated and mixed dispatch units and suited to the use of jawed loaders as well as materials handling technology and automatic storage systems. Definition of functional unit: products are compared on the basis of providing the same defined function or unit of service which is called the functional unit. The function of produce containers is to transport fresh produce from growers to retail locations. In the case of the RPCs and DRCs, the containers can also be used to display the produce at retail stores. The functional unit of this LCA is based on an equivalent quantity of produce delivered to stores: 1,000 tonnes of produce delivered to retail stores in North America (US or Canada).",Brambles,Australia,Trading Companies & Distributors and Commercial Services & Supplies,Not used for 2015 reporting,Comm. equipm. & capital goods,2.4062,Estimated from external data based on product description,89.567,37.22,ISO,(not reported by company),N/a,N/a (no %change reported),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data),None
