Unless otherwise indicated in the name or in other data fields, the functional unit of the life cycle assessment is the product across its entire assumed life (e.g., PCF is per 10 years of a car rather than per km driven)"
Product detail,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,Detailed product description as provided by reporting company
Company,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,N/a
Country (where company is incorporated),Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,Note this may differ from the country where the product is manufactured and/or used
Company's GICS Industry Group,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,GICS = Global Industry Classification Standard (https://www.msci.com/gics)
Company's GICS Industry,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,GICS = Global Industry Classification Standard (https://www.msci.com/gics)
Company's sector,Product level,Added during study,Text,"1 of 8 broader industry sectors, defined and mapped based on GICs for this study"
Product weight (kg),Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Numeric,"Typically gross weight of product (i.e. with packaging), except for bulk products"
Source for product weight,Product level,Added during study,Text,"""Estimated…"" indicates that company did not report product weight directly to CDP, but weight was inferred based on product's company, name, and description (e.g., via spec sheets on respective websites)"
"Product's carbon footprint (PCF, kg CO2e)",Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Numeric,N/a
Carbon intensity,Product level,Added during study,Numeric,Equals PCF divided by product weight (unit-less)
Protocol used for PCF,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,N/a
Relative change in PCF vs previous,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Numeric (unless n/a),Negative value means PCF reduction
Company-reported reason for change,Product level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,N/a
Change reason category,Product level,Added during study,Text,6 categories (4 in case a PCF change was reported; 2 others that indicate why a change was not reported)
%Upstream estimated from %Operations,Product level,Added during study,Text,"""Yes"" indicates that, for this product, upstream and operations emissions were reported only as combined figure, but subsequently split based on the product's sector average"
Upstream CO2e (fraction of total PCF),Product level,Added during study,Numeric (unless n/a),"Ranges from 0-100% (or ""N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data)"" in case product does not include stage level data). Note that upstream always includes transportation-related emissions, whether these were separately reported or not"
Operations CO2e (fraction of total PCF),Product level,Added during study,Numeric (unless n/a),"Ranges from 0-100% (or ""N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data)"" in case product does not include stage level data). Note that operations may always include transportation-related emissions, whether these were separately reported or not"
Downstream CO2e (fraction of total PCF),Product level,Added during study,Numeric (unless n/a),"Ranges from 0-100% (or ""N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data)"" in case product does not include stage level data). Note that downstream always includes transportation- and EndOfLife-related emissions, whether these were separately reported or not"
Transport CO2e (fraction of total PCF),Product level,Added during study,Numeric (unless n/a),"3 options: (i) 0-100%; (ii) ""(included in up/downstream but not reported separately)"" in case reported stage breakdown was not detailed enough; (iii) ""N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data)"" in case product does not include stage level data at all"
EndOfLife CO2e (fraction of total PCF),Product level,Added during study,Numeric (unless n/a),"3 options: (i) 0-100%; (ii) ""(included in downstream but not reported separately)"" in case reported stage breakdown was not detailed enough; (iii) ""N/a (product with insufficient stage-level data)"" in case product does not include stage level data at all"
Modifications to raw data (if any),Product level,Added during study,Text,"Specified (if any) all modification/corrections that were applied to the data as reported to CDP (e.g., correcting a unit from kg to gram in case this is clearly evident from other company reported data)"
Description of LCA stage,Stage level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,This is verbatim the description as reported by the company
Scope-characterization of LCA stage,Stage level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Text,"This is verbatim the characterization as reported by the company. PCF does not typically use the scope 1, 2, 3 framework but the CDP questionnaire includes this field in order to provide further insight (e.g., to differentiate scope 3-related ""manufacturing"" (by the company's suppliers) from scope 1/2 ""manufacturing"" (by the company itself))"
Assigned value chain portion,Stage level,Added during study,Text,"3 options: Upstream; operations (i.e., company's own manufacturing and operations); downstream. The mapping was carried out as part of this study using the company-reported fields ""Description of LCA stage"" and ""Scope-characterization"". See manuscript for further explanations and examples"
Emissions at stage (kg CO2e),Stage level,Raw data as reported to CDP,Numeric (unless n/a),N/a
Emissions at this stage exclusively tranport,Stage level,Added during study,Text,"""Yes"" indicates that the emissions at this stage could not only be mapped to upstream, operations, and downstream, but further identified as exclusively transport-related. The mapping was carried out as part of this study using the company-reported fields ""Description of LCA stage"" and ""Scope-characterization"". See manuscript for further explanations and examples"
Emissions at this stage exclusively EndOfLife,Stage level,Added during study,Text,"""Yes"" indicates that the emissions at this stage could not only be mapped to downstream, but further identified as exclusively EndOfLife-related. The mapping was carried out as part of this study using the company-reported fields ""Description of LCA stage"" and ""Scope-characterization"". See manuscript for further explanations and examples"
